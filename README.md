üó∫Ô∏è * I'm often hanging out by the docks or by spawn. Usually I'm in the middle of the map.

* I type fast, sorry if I make no sense.
ü´Ç * ALWAYS open for C + H, don't even have to ask :)!
* I may sometimes be offtab but I never usually specify when I am, so make sure to whisper me anything you have to say so I can see it.
