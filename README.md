# HAHAHA
‚ú® Hello! My name is Venegas, but if you want, you can call me Vinnie or whatever cosplay I'm currently in. I use she/her pronouns. You may have seen me around, or maybe even coloring trees! Wherever you're from, you can have some info about me :D

üçé # PONYTOWN INFO
---- 

üó∫Ô∏è * I'm often hanging out by the docks or by spawn. Usually I'm in the middle of the map.

* I always love to join GTC or Fashion Roulettes, even if I'm bad at them, haha!

* I switch from server to server, and sometimes I wander onto foreign servers, though there aren't many things to do there..

* I type fast, sorry if I make no sense.

ü´Ç * ALWAYS open for C + H, don't even have to ask :)!

* I may sometimes be offtab but I never usually specify when I am, so make sure to whisper me anything you have to say so I can see it.
  
* Don't copy my skins, but I'm open to teach you how I did certain parts of them (Hair, shading, clothes, etc.)

:raccoon: # ABOUT ME
----

* She/her, please! Though, I know being in cosplays makes it difficult to tell, so its alright if you use other prns!

* I'm an ENTP-T, if that matters to you.

* My favorite animal is the bear. No specific species, though.

üêà‚Äç‚¨õ * I have 4 cats and I love them all so, so dearly. 

* Progressive Christian! That means that no, I don't think being a minority is a sin. God loves all his children! If you aren't Christian, thats totally fine, just be respectful, please! I am an ex-satanist/witch/hellenist/judaist, all from different periods of my life, so chances are, I understand where you're coming from if you're uncomfortable being around religious people. Thats alright! I won't push it on anybody, though I do openly show my love for God.
