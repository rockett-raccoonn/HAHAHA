* I don't have a main spot where I hang out, I'm just kind of everywhere.

* I've made my home on the safe server, you'll rarely see me outside of it.

* I type fast, sorry if I make no sense.

* ALWAYS open for C + H, don't even have to ask (หต โขฬ แด - หต ) โง

* I may sometimes be offtab but I never usually specify when I am, so make sure to whisper me anything you have to say so I can see it.
  
* Please don't copy my skins. That said, I am open to teach you how I did certain parts of them! (Hair, shading, clothes, etc.)

๐ ๐ ๐ ๐ ๐

* She/her, please! Though, I know being in cosplays makes it difficult to tell, so its alright if you use other prns!

* I'm an ENFP-T, if that matters to you.

* I'm a furry and have been in the community for as long as i can remember.

* My favorite animal is the monkey. No specific species, though.

* I have 5 cats and I love them all so, so dearly แโ ^. .^โ

* Progressive Christian! โฑ That means that no, I don't think being a minority is a sin. If you aren't Christian, thats totally fine, just be respectful, please! I am an ex-satanist/witch/hellenist/judaist, all from different periods of my life, so chances are, I understand where you're coming from if you're uncomfortable being around religious people. Thats alright! I won't push it on anybody, though I do openly show my love for God. Whoever you worship, if anyone at all, I respect you if you respect me. (เนยด>แ<)~*
