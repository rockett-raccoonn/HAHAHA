˚˖𓍢🦢˚  PONYTOWN INFO

* I don't have a main spot where I hang out, I'm just kind of everywhere. I've made my home on the safe server, you'll rarely see me outside of it.

* I type fast, sorry if I make no sense.

* Open for C + H, you don't even have to ask (˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧

* I may sometimes be offtab but I never usually specify when I am, so make sure to whisper me anything you have to say so I can see it.
  
* Please don't copy my skins. That said, I am open to teach you how I did certain parts of them! (Hair, shading, clothes, etc.)

˚˖𓍢🦢˚   FANDOM AND PERSONAL INTERESTS

I have soo many interests, but here are just a few of them..

* Guardians of the Galaxy, Oneyplays, Care Bears, MLP, Just Dance (yes, the game), Journey to the West and most media surrounding it, and Fool's Gold.

* As far as music goes, I'll list what I can remember.. Vundabar, Elliotly, Kimya Dawson, Alex G, The Crane Wives, Tyler the Creator, Mitski, Fredo Disco, Meth Wax, Glass Animals New Jeans, and probably way more, too! My absolute favs are Nicole Dollanganger and Sophie Woodhouse.

* Digital and traditional illustration, character design, guitar, harmonica, piano, comic books, thrifting, religious studies.

* Morute, coquette, dollette, cutecore. It helps me heal! I know these communities all have stigmas so, let me get this out of the way, I am not a proshipper, profic, or anything like that! If it helps you heal, fine, whatever, but I will block you if you present that stuff publically.

˚˖𓍢🦢˚  ABOUT ME

* She/her, please! Though, I know being in cosplays makes it difficult to tell, so its alright if you use other prns!

* I'm an ENFP-T, if that matters to you.

* I'm a furry and have been in the community for as long as I can remember.

* My favorite animal is the monkey. No specific species, though.

* I have 5 cats and I love them all so, so dearly ᓚ₍ ^. .^₎

* Progressive Christian! ♱ That means that no, I don't think being a minority is a sin. If you aren't Christian, thats totally fine, just be respectful, please! I am an ex-satanist/witch/hellenist/judaist, all from different periods of my life, so chances are, I understand where you're coming from if you're uncomfortable being around religious people. Thats alright! I won't push it on anybody, though I do openly show my love for God. Whoever you worship, if anyone at all, I respect you if you respect me. (๑´>᎑<)~*
